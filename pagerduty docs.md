# PagerDuty + Stack Moxie Integration Benefits

* ***Create PagerDuty incidents easily on any failed Stack Moxie test.***

# How it Works

# Requirements
* ***Users will need to be an Org Admin on their Stack Moxie account. This will give them access to the admin page, where they can set up their PagerDuty connection***
* ***PagerDuty integrations require an Admin base role for account authorization. If you do not have this role, please reach out to an Admin or Account Owner within your organization to configure the integration.***
* ***Users will need to have at least one Service set up in their PagerDuty account.***
